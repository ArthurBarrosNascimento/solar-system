# Project Solar Systen ü™ê

<p>This project is important to me because it marks the beginning of a widely used tool in Front-End development, React.

In this project, we implemented new knowledge in React, a framework that works with HTML and JavaScript tags. It was fun to develop this project because I was able to apply my learning about APIs and implement new knowledge in React. We had to use an API that returns information about planets in the solar system and dynamically render them on the user interface.</p>

<p>The project was carried out during the FullStack Programming course at Trybe, using knowledge of React and JavaScript.</p>
